                    Hello, welcome to my personal portfolio, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                    although these are not my most proficient technical skills. Well, first of all, 
                    allow me to introduce myself, shall I? My name is Douglas Holanda. I am an 
                    undergraduate student in Systems Analysis and Development and am committed to 
                    continuous learning in programming and software development. I have knowledge

                    <p>
                        A constantly changing world demands agility, for example, in one of my last projects, 
                        the short delivery time was not our enemy because I managed to be agile in development.

                    <p>
                        I have excellent communicative skills, these were acquired through the habit of reading. 
                        In a previous job, I wrote descriptive and detailed reports, in addition to assertive 
                        communication with all members involved.

                    <p>
                        I am someone who highly values ​​team work, always considering, of course, responsibility.
                        I always get involved in teams where the focus is on leveraging each member's capabilities 
                        and visions in order to overcome challenges.

                    <p>
                        Resilience is the key for the present and future time. An example was during my academic training,
                        a social and financial crisis made me develop adaptive strategies in order to overcome adversity,
                        as a result, I obtained significant academic results.

                        Leadership
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I see leadership as a mission to inspire and guide a team so that everyone can achieve success in the 
                        proposed objectives. In the work I worked on as a leader, I always sought assertive communication with 
                        all members in order to ensure that everyone was aligned and focused.

                    <p>
                        This is the soft skill that I see as the most fundamental in our area, the ability 
                        to fulfill commitments made and gain the trust. An example of this was when, 
                        in the absence of helpful colleagues, I took on the responsibility of delivering the 
                        project according to the established deadlines and with transparence.

                                Worked on a scientific initiation research project. This project consisted of carrying out experiments
                                based on winning solutions from financial competitions carried out on the Kaggle platform and selecting
                                predictor variables and, based on this, measuring the carbon footprint left by each pipeline execution 
                                in processing time, taking into account the existing literature on green artificial intelligence.

                                Completed the educational track in blockchain technology. In this track, it was possible to obtain
                                knowledge about computer networks, distributed systems, information security, smart contracts, 
                                tokenization and encryption. Based on this, it masters the development, implementation and deployment 
                                of smart contracts in Solidity language, mainly in local blockchain networks that simulate the Ethereum 
                                network, through the Ganache and Truffle applications.

                               He took the online Python course for data science promoted by Data Science Academy, where he learned about the 
                               use of this language for modeling systems that use data science and the combination of this with software 
                               engineering, which are machine learning and deep learning. Masters algorithms such as Random Forest, 
                               Support Vector Machine, LightGBM, K-Nearest Neighbors and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
