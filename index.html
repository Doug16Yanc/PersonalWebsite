                    Hello, welcome to my personal portfolio, created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                    although these are not my most proficient technical skills. Well, first of all, 
                    allow me to introduce myself, shall I? My name is Douglas Holanda. I am an 
                    undergraduate student in Systems Analysis and Development and am committed to 
                    continuous learning in programming and software development. I have knowledge
                    in languages such as Java, Kotlin, Python, frameworks and libraries like 
                    Spring Boot and FastAPI, in addition to being familiar with the world of 
                    machine learning and deep learning. I am also well-versed in DevOps, especially 
                    Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD, and relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. 
                    Additionally, I have skills with distributed and decentralized systems like blockchain 
                    technology, smart contracts for Ethereum network and Solidity language.
                </p>
